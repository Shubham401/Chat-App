## Introduction
This is a code repository for Realtime Chat Application.
I have used React on the frontend, with NodeJS + Socket.io on the backend.
By going through this code, you will have a strong understanding of how to send and receive messages using sockets and socket.io to make any real-time application.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
